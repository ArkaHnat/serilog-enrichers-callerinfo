A simple Serilog enricher to add information about the calling method. Loosely based on [Serilog.Enrichers.WithCaller](https://github.com/pmetz-steelcase/Serilog.Enrichers.WithCaller), but with the properties split up for a consistent format that can be parsed automatically.

Performance may be low due the usage of reflection to obtain assembly and method information, as well as the retrieval of the current stacktrace whenever a new log event is added.

To get the actual method that emitted the log event, the stack trace is traversed and the first method that is in a matching assembly is considered the correct one.

To configure which assemblies are the correct one, one can either use the configuration method with `assemblyPrefix` or the one that directly accepts a collection of fully qualified assembly names. 
When passing in only a prefix, the assembly that calls the configuration method is recursively analyzed for referenced assemblies and whether they match the prefix. 
If you e.g. have a solution with projects being called `MySolution.Web`, `MySolution.Domain`, etc., you can limit the included assemblies by passing in the prefix `MySolution`. 
Be aware that the assembly from which you configure the logger must also have the correct prefix, otherwise no assemblies will be considered and the enricher won't work.
To define a custom assembly from which to start scanning referenced assemblies (instead of the calling assembly), you can define the optional `startingAssembly` parameter, which must be a fully qualified assembly name.

## Usage

```csharp
// With assembly prefix
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .Enrich.WithCallerInfo(
        includeFileInfo: true, 
        assemblyPrefix: "MySolution.",
        prefix: "myprefix_",
        filePathDepth: 3,
        excludedPrefixes: new List<string> { "SomeOtherProject." })
    .WriteTo.InMemory()
    .CreateLogger();

// With fully qualified assembly names
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .Enrich.WithCallerInfo(
        includeFileInfo: true, 
        allowedAssemblies: new List<string> { "Serilog.Enrichers.CallerInfo.Tests" }, 
        prefix: "myprefix_")
    .WriteTo.InMemory()
    .CreateLogger();
```

Or via `appsettings.json` (using [Serilog.Settings.Configuration](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-settings-configuration)):

With assembly prefix (when configuring via `appsettings.json`, you **have to define the starting assembly**, as the calling assembly is otherwise `Serilog.Settings.Configuration` (see [#1](https://github.com/pm4net/serilog-enrichers-callerinfo/issues/1))):
```json
"Serilog": {
    "Enrich": [
      {
        "Name": "WithCallerInfo",
        "Args": {
          "includeFileInfo": "true",
          "assemblyPrefix": "MySolution.",
          "startingAssembly": "MySolution.Web"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```

With fully qualified assembly names:
```json
"Serilog": {
    "Enrich": [
      {
        "Name": "WithCallerInfo",
        "Args": {
          "includeFileInfo": "true",
          "allowedAssemblies": [ "Assembly1", "Assembly2" ],
          "prefix": "myprefix_"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```

## Properties

The following properties are added:

| Property | Description | Depends on |

| `Method` | The calling method |  |
| `Namespace` | The namespace of the calling method (including class name) |  |
| `SourceFile` | The path of the source file of the calling method | `includeFileInfo` and `filePathDepth` |
| `LineNumber` | The line number of the calling method | `includeFileInfo` |
| `ColumnNumber` | The column number of the calling method | `includeFileInfo` |
| `MethodParameters` | The parameters of the calling method.  | `_includeMethodParameterTypes`,`_includeMethodParameterNames` |
| `MethodParametersValues` | The parameters values of the calling method | `includeMethodParametersValues` |
| `MethodReturnType` | The return type of the calling method | `includeMethodReturnType` |
